# Portfolio Web

    #### Description: 
    Web portfolio for my photographer and DOP career.

    It is a web application made using Python and the Flask framework.
    The file project.py contains the main structure of the application
    where I created all the routes for the website: video, photo, about
    and contact.

    I also implemented a function that reads all the files in a specific
    directory in /static and creates an html section to display it using
    jinja and html(I'm proud of that function!)

    Using html and css I created the frontend for all the sections and gave
    them some structure and graphic design. CSS is hard and I had to look up
    many solutions for displaying the images and videos as a grid with the 
    same size, but I think I made it in the end.

    I plan to deploy the website and use it to get more jobs as a photographer
    and videographer

    Wish me luck!
